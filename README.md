## About

This is an Atlassian Bitbucket Server plugin that enforces commit message requirements. If a commit violates the
configured policies, the push to the repository will be rejected.

Features:

* Configure globally or per-repository
* Require commit committer name and email to match Bitbucket Server user
* Require commit messages to match regex
* Require commit message to contain valid JIRA issue ids
* Issue JQL matcher to validate JIRA issue against. Require issues to be assigned, not closed, in a certain project, etc.
The possibilities are endless!
* No extra JIRA configuration is required. Will use existing JIRA Application Link!
* Validate branch names.
* Customizable error messages (header, footer, and specific errors).
* Branch friendly! Only *new* commits are checked. Commits that already exist in the repository will be skipped.

## Quick Start

1. Download plugin from [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.isroot.stash.plugin.yacc) or compile from source
2. Install YACC plugin into Bitbucket Server
3. If you want to require valid JIRA issues, configure a JIRA Application Link in Bitbucket Server
4. Configure YACC globally or per-repository

## Configuration

### How To Configure

YACC can be configured globally or per-repository. 

To configure per-repository settings, go to the [repository's hook configuration page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-repository-hooks-776639836.html#Usingrepositoryhooks-Managinghooks).

To configure global settings, click the YACC Configure button in the [Universal Plugin Manager](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Configuring+add-ons).

Global settings will apply to all repositories that don't have YACC enabled per-repository. Once YACC is enabled for a repository, then all global settings will be superseded by the per-repository settings for that particular repository.

### Supported Configuration Settings

#### Require Matching Committer Email

If enabled, committer email must match the email of the Bitbucket Server user.

#### Require Matching Committer Name

If enabled, committer name must match the name of the Bitbucket Server user.

#### Committer Email Regex

If a regex is present, the committer email must match regex.

#### Commit Message Regex

If a regex is present, commit message must match regex.

Example,

    [A-Z0-9\-]+: .*

will require commit message to be in the form of:

    PROJ-123: added new feature xyz

##### Multi-line Commit Messages

Multi-line commit messages can be matched by including newlines into the regex (like `(.|\n)*`), or by enabling Pattern.DOTALL using the `(?s)` embedded flag expression. 

#### Require Valid JIRA Issue(s)

If enabled, commit messages must contain valid JIRA issue ids. JIRA issue ids are defined as any item that matches
the regex `[A-Z][A-Z_0-9]+-[0-9]+`.

This check requires JIRA to be first linked with Bitbucket Server using an [Application Link](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/linking-bitbucket-server-with-jira-776640408.html).

*Note:* This may result in false positives if commit messages contains strings that look like JIRA issue, for example, "UTF-8". Enable `Ignore Unknown JIRA Project Keys` to tell YACC to ignore items that don't contain a valid JIRA Project key.

##### Locating Issues Using a Regex Group

If a regex group is present in the `Commit Message Regex`, only text contained within this group will be examined when extracting JIRA issues.

For example, a `([A-Z0-9\-]+): .*` commit message regex will mean only `PROJ-123` will be checked against JIRA in the following commit message:

    PROJ-123: fixed bug involving UTF-8 support. I deserve a HIGH-5 for this fix!

UTF-8 and HIGH-5 will be ignored because they are not contained within the regex group. Using a regex group can be used as an alternative to `Ignore Unknown JIRA Project Keys` to deal with issue false positives, especially when you want to detect project key typos.

#### Ignore Unknown JIRA Project Keys

If enabled, any issue-like items in commit messages that do not contain a valid JIRA project key (such as "UTF-8") will be ignored.

#### Issue JQL Matcher

If JQL query is present, detected JIRA issues must match this query.

For example,

     assignee is not empty and status="in progress" and project=PROJ

will require that JIRA issues be assigned, in progess, and from project PROJ.

See [JIRA Advanced Searching](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching) for documentation regarding writing and testing
JQL queries.

#### Branch Name Regex

If present, only branches with names that match this regex will be allowed to be created. This also
affects branches created within the Bitbucket Server UI. This only affects _new_ branches, existing
branches that don't match this regex will still be allowed.

For example, `master|(?:(?:bugfix|hotfix|feature)/[A-Z]+-\d+-.+)` would enforce that branch names
follow the Bitbucket Server Branching Model naming convention.

#### Exclude Merge Commits

If enabled, merge commits will be excluded from commit requirements.

#### Exclude by Regex

If present, commits will be excluded from all requirements except matching committer email/name if part of the commit message matches this regex.

*Example:* `^Revert \"|#skipchecks`

#### Exclude Service User Commits

If enabled, commits from service users (ie, using [SSH Access Keys](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/ssh-access-keys-for-system-use-776639781.html))
will be excluded from commit requirements.

##### Exclude Commits From Users
 
Comma delimited list of BitBucket User Names. Commits from these users will be
excluded from commit requirements.

## FAQ

#### I am getting a JIRA authentication failed message when attempting to push my code or when trying to configure an issue JQL matcher.

This can occur if Bitbucket Server is configured to use OAuth to authenticate with JIRA and the currently logged in Bitbucket Server user has
not yet gone through the OAuth authorization process to allow Bitbucket Server access to JIRA.

To initialize the OAuth tokens, go into the Bitbucket Server UI and do something that requires access to JIRA. For example, view
the commits for a repository and click on an linked JIRA issue for an existing commit. See [Bitbucket Server JIRA Integration](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/jira-integration-776639874.html#JIRAintegration-issues)
for an example of this.

There might be a better way to do this, but this what has worked for me :-)

#### YACC is rejecting my push complaining that my user name and/or email is wrong but the `Author:` from `git log` is correct!

Or, YACC is still complaining even after I fixed my commit using `git commit --amend --author`.

This is due to the fact that YACC checks the commit's *Committer* information against the Bitbucket Server user,
not *Author*. These are normally the same; however, will be different when applying patches on behalf
of someone else or cherry picking commits.

You can verify the problem by using `git log --pretty=full` to see a commit's Committer information.

If your git settings where misconfigured, you can fix both the Author and Committer for your last
commit by doing:

    # Fix configuration
    git config user.name Your Name
    git config user.email your@email.com

    # Reset both author and committer
    git commit --amend --reset-author

Some useful development information:

### Enable Logging

Enabling YACC logging can be done using the Bitbucket Server REST API. For example, see the following `curl` command which enables logging in the `atlas-run` development environment:

    curl -u admin -v -X PUT -d "" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:7990/bitbucket/rest/api/latest/logs/logger/com.isroot/debug

### Atlassian SDK

See `README_ATLASSIAN.txt` for the original Atlassian SDK README that contains some useful SDK commands.
